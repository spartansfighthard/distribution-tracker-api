# Production Fixes for SOL Distribution Tracker API

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Initialization

**Issue**: The API server was being initialized twice, causing port conflicts and errors.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate call to `initializeApp()` in `api/index.js`.

### 2. Force-Refresh Endpoint 404 Error

**Issue**: The force-refresh endpoint was returning a 404 error in the Vercel production environment.

**Fix**: 
- Created a standalone serverless function in `api/force-refresh.js` specifically for the force-refresh endpoint
- Updated the Vercel configuration in `vercel.json` to route `/api/force-refresh` to this new function
- The standalone function is simpler and less likely to time out in the serverless environment

### 3. Testing Scripts

**Issue**: Needed a way to test the API endpoints in both local and production environments.

**Fix**:
- Created `test-api.js` for testing local endpoints
- Created `test-production-api.js` for testing production endpoints
- Created `test-force-refresh-endpoint.js` specifically for testing the force-refresh endpoint

## Deployment Instructions

1. Commit and push these changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix production issues and add standalone force-refresh endpoint"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes when you push to the main branch.

3. After deployment, test the API using:
   ```
   node test-production-api.js
   node test-force-refresh-endpoint.js
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Background Jobs**: The API includes background jobs for auto-fetching transactions. The interval is set in the `CONFIG` object in `api/index.js`.

2. **Error Handling**: The API includes comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes in the production environment.

3. **Logging**: The API logs important events and errors, which can be viewed in the Vercel logs.

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Implement more aggressive caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

3. **Authentication**: Add authentication for sensitive endpoints.

4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts for the API.
