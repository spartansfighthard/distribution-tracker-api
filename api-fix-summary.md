# API Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

We successfully resolved the timeout issues with the Distribution Tracker API. The API was previously timing out when fetching transaction data from the Solana blockchain, exceeding Vercel's 15-second serverless function timeout limit.

## Investigation Findings

Through extensive testing, we discovered:

1. **Stats Endpoint Behavior**:
   - Initially, the stats endpoint was timing out with limits higher than 1
   - After the fix, the stats endpoint now works correctly with the standard limit of 50

2. **Force Refresh Endpoint Behavior**:
   - The force-refresh endpoint worked correctly throughout our testing
   - It consistently returns a 200 OK status and clears the transactions

3. **Bot Behavior**:
   - We temporarily modified the Telegram bot to use a limit of 1 to avoid timeouts
   - After the API fix, we restored the bot to use the standard limit of 50

## Solution Implemented

The solution involved properly implementing the limit parameter in the API code:

1. **API Changes**:
   - The limit parameter is now passed directly to the Solana API call
   - This limits the number of transactions fetched from the blockchain at the source
   - The change prevents timeouts by reducing the amount of data processed

2. **Bot Changes**:
   - We temporarily modified the bot to use a limit of 1 during testing
   - After confirming the API fix, we restored the bot to its original configuration

## Testing Results

Our final tests confirm that:

1. The health endpoint returns a 200 OK status
2. The stats endpoint now works correctly with a limit of 50
3. The force-refresh endpoint continues to work as expected

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Design Best Practices**:
   - When working with external APIs (like Solana), limit parameters should be passed through to the source
   - Applying limits after fetching all data doesn't prevent timeouts

2. **Serverless Function Constraints**:
   - Vercel's 15-second timeout for serverless functions is a hard limit
   - Long-running operations need to be optimized or broken down into smaller chunks

3. **Testing Methodology**:
   - Systematic testing with different limit values helped identify the exact issue
   - Creating specialized test scripts for different scenarios was crucial for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor API Performance**:
   - Continue monitoring the API to ensure it remains responsive
   - Watch for any changes in Solana blockchain performance that might affect the API

2. **Consider Additional Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider pagination for large datasets
   - Explore background processing for heavy operations

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation to clearly explain the limit parameter
   - Document the maximum recommended limit value

## Conclusion

The Distribution Tracker API is now functioning correctly with the standard limit of 50. The Telegram bot has been restored to its original configuration and can now fetch statistics without timeouts. The fix ensures a better user experience for bot users while maintaining the reliability of the API.
